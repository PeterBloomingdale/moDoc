## Model Objectives

* Clearly state the scientific question the model is intending to address  
    * *What dose level is required to reach the desired level of target engagement?*
* Outline the specific objectives of the model
    a. *Characterize the pharmacokinetics of drug X in preclinical species and human*
    b. *Determine the dose-response relationship for drug X and biomarker Y*
    c. *Perform a clinical trial simulation*

Note: The scientific question and model objectives should be clearly defined and specific. This section should provide the reader with a clear understanding of why the model was developed and what it is intended to accomplish.

## Data

* Description of the data sources used to develop the model and how they were used. This could include information such as the type of data (e.g., clinical trial data, observational data, etc.), the number of samples, and the population characteristics.
    * *Phase II clincial PK data for Drug X in disease Y was obtained from the literature and is available in supplementary materials as `data1.csv`. This dataset has A patients and B samples. Patient demographics are...*
* Information on how the data was obtained, preprocessed, and cleaned before being used for model development. 
    * *Missing data was handled by...*
    * *BLQ data was handled by...*
    * *Data was digitzed using the software...*
* Summarizing the data used into a table is recommended. The data table could include additional columns such as sample size, population characteristics, and data handling information. However, it might be best to have this information described in text and only display the summary of the dataset in the table along with the filename and source to reduce the size of the table.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
data <- data.frame(Data = c("Phase II clinical PK data for Drug X in disease Y", "In vitro data for Drug X inhibiting biomarker Y", "Phase III clincial PD Data"),
                   Filename = c("data1.csv", "data2.csv", "private"),
                   Source = c("Reference", "Internal", "Internal"))
kable(data, align ="c", caption = "Example Data Table")

## Model Development

* Provide any relevant background information for model development
* Provide the granularity/scope of model development
    * *We used in vitro data to mode the cellular/molecular processes in disease Y tissue*
    * *We linked changes in biomarker Y to clinical endpoint Z*
* Describe the sources of data used to develop the model, literature or experimental data
    * *In vitro data was obtained from in house experiments*
    * *Clincial data was digitized from the literature in {reference}*
* Provide a step-wise description of the model development process, including what software or programming languages were used. Was the model developed new or was a previous model used as a starting point.

Note: The Model Development section should provide a detailed description of how the model was developed, including the methods and data used. The Structure, Parameters, and Assumptions subsections should provide specific information about the model structure, parameter values, and assumptions made during model development. This information should be sufficient for a reader to understand the model, how it was developed, and hopefully enable its reproducibility and usability.

### Structure

* Describe the overall structure of the model, including compartments and pathways
* Provide a diagram or illustration of the model structure
    * *Command to diplay an image: `![Model Diagram Caption](ModelDiagram.png)`*
* Write and explain mathematical equations and algorithms

*Write model equations using the following syntax:*

\begin{equation} 
C(t) = C_{0} \cdot e^{-k \cdot t} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{dC}{dt} = -k \cdot t 
\end{equation} 

Note that you can use an online LaTeX editor to help with the equation syntax, such as: [LaTeX Editor](https://latexeditor.lagrida.com/).

### Parameters

* List and define all model parameters and provide a summary in the table.
* Describe how parameter values were determined and any calculations used.
    1. *Clearance (CL) was obtained from experimental data...* 
    2. *Volume of distribution in the central compartment (V1) was obtained from literature*
    3. *Distributional clearance (CLD) was obtained from experimental data...*
    4. *Volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment (V2) was assumed*
* Provide references and sources, such as literature, experimental data, or assumptions.
* Indicate any assumptions or simplifications made in determining parameter values.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- data.frame(Parameter = c("CL", "V1", "CLD", "V2"),
                   Units = c(1, 5, 2.5, 20),
                   Value = c("L/h","L","L/h","L"),
                   Reference = c("Experiment", "Literature", "Experiment", "Assumed"))
kable(data, caption = "Example Parameter Table")
```


### Assumptions

* List and explain any assumptions made in the model development, such as simplifications of biological processes or neglect of certain variables
* Describe the impact of these assumptions on the model predictions and overall accuracy
* Explain any uncertainty or variability in the model predictions due to these assumptions
* Outline any major challenges or limitations encountered during model development and how they were addressed
* Describe model assumptions using a table and the recommended columns (Assumption, Justification, Sensitivity Analysis, Uncertainty, and Source)
    * **Assumption**: Describe the assumption in a clear and concise manner.
    * **Justification**: Explain the reasoning behind the assumption. Include relevant research, literature, or expert opinions supporting the assumption.
    * **Sensitivity**: Describe how the assumption affects the model output and how sensitive the model is to changes in the assumption. It could include any sensitivity analysis performed on the model, such as a range of values for the assumption or a list of alternative assumptions that were considered.
    * **Uncertainty**: Describe the level of uncertainty associated with the assumption. This could include any uncertainty analysis that was performed on the assumption, such as a range of possible values or a probability distribution.
    * **Source**: This column should cite the sources of the assumptions, such as publications, regulations or expert opinions.

Note: Sensitivity analysis focuses on how changes in an assumption affect the model output, while uncertainty analysis focuses on the level of confidence in the assumption.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- data.frame(Assumption = c("Assumption 1", "Assumption 2"),
                   Justification = c("Justification 1", "Justification 2"),
                   Sensitivity = c("Sensitivity 1", "Sensitivity 2"),
                   Uncertainty = c("Uncertainty 1", "Uncertainty 2"),
                   Source = c("Source 1", "Source 2"))
kable(data, caption = "Example Assumption Table")
```

## Model Validation

* Describe the scope of the model validation and methods/data used to validate the model, such as comparison to experimental data or other models.
    * *The model was validated using clinical data in patients with disease Y. Patients were at this stage of the disease with the following range/distribution of demographics (age, sex, race, etc.). The model was validated for doses ranging between A and B.*
* Indicate any areas where the model may not be suitable for certain applications, such as dose range, species, or disease states.
* Provide any relevant statistical measures, such as $R^2$ or root mean square error (RMSE)
* Provide any relevant figures or tables to support the validation of the model
* Provide any references or citations for the validation data. 
* For models that have extensive validation data from multiple sources, you could consider summarizing this data in a table.

Note: The Model Validation section should provide a clear and thorough assessment of the model's performance and accuracy. This section should include any relevant statistical measures and figures to support the validation, as well as a description of the scope of the validation. The reader should understand the limitations and uncertainties of the model predictions and under what conditions the model is suitable to use.

## Additional Considerations

Certain models could consider the following additional sections if relevant:

### Model Credibility

Describe the model's authors, development team and their qualifications.
Provide any relevant publications, presentations or patents that the authors have on the model.
Describe any external review that the model has undergone and the outcome of the review.

### Model Maintenance

Describe any ongoing maintenance or updating schedule for the model.
Explain any methods for submitting bug reports or suggestions for model improvements.
Describe any support or help resources available for users of the model.

### Model Version

This section could include version number of the model, the date of the last update, and a brief summary of any changes that were made in that version. This would allow users to keep track of the different versions of the model and to easily identify which version of the model they are using.

Additionally, providing information on the version history of the model can help users to understand how the model has evolved over time, and to identify which version of the model is most appropriate for their specific needs. This can be particularly important when the model is frequently updated or when different versions of the model are used for different applications.

It's worth noting that versioning and documentation is important for reproducibility, allowing to trace the model's development, testing, and validation, and could be supportive information for regulatory submission of the model.
